# 🚚 Realistic Order Delivery System (DSA Project)

This project is a **DSA-based Order Delivery System** that simulates how real delivery apps (like Foodpanda, Careem, etc.) work.  
It includes **order management, rider assignment, route visualization, and real-time rider movement on a map.**

This project is designed for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and demonstrates the use of **queues, linked lists, arrays, and file handling** in a real-world scenario.

- Remove/cancel order  
- Finalize order  
- Display total bill  

### 🚴 Rider System (Using Array / Linked List)
- List of available riders  
- Assign order to nearest rider  
- Rider status changes: **Available → Busy → Completed**

### 🗺️ Interactive Real Map (Leaflet.js)
- Real world map (no API key required)  
- Select any location from dropdown  
- Order pickup & delivery points shown  
- Realistic route drawn between points  

### 🎬 Rider Real-Time Movement (Animation)
- Rider moves along the shown route  
- Time depends on selected distance  
- Smooth motion to look realistic
